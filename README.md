# currency_converter
In my program I imported library java.io.*, which Provides for system input and output through data streams, serialization and the file system.

I created "main" method where I created BufferedWriter and BufferedReader, surrounded with try-catch blocks in order not to get a bug.
The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.

I converted the following currencies manually, but in the bottom of the file "Main.java" there is sendHttpGetRequest() method. 
Using this method you can convert currency using Fixer.io and get JSON response.
